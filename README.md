This repo serves a few functions:
1) it contains my dotfiles (`.bash_profile`, `.vimrc`) etc. in case I break them
2) It should contain an install script that allows anybody to install a tmux/vim-with-plugin setup in an environment without sudo privileges (useful for remote working from a server, for example), but when you have become accustomed to your own setup.


Feel free to fork and edit, and raise issues/PRs for any suggestions.
